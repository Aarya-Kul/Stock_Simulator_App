# Stock_Simulator_App
A web application where users can buy and sell real-time stocks to add to their portfolio!

## Motivation
I wanted to build my web development skills by learning Flask and using it in this project. I utilized Harvard cs50 functions and a bunch of other libraries as well. You can buy and sell stocks through this stock market simulator at real time prices. The simulation will help you develop a very beginner sense of maintaining a stock portfolio.

## Running the Web App
As of now the app is only available when I run Flask on my personal machine. Trying to host on Azure soon.

Anyone can use the link to vist the web page as long as the Flask server is running.
