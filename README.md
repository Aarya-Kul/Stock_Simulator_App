# Stock_Simulator_App
A web application where users can buy and sell real-time stocks to add to their portfolio!

## Motivation
I wanted to build my web development skills by learning Flask and using it in this project. Buy and sell stocks through this stock market simulator at real time prices. The simulation will help you develop a very beginner sense of maintaining a stock portfolio.

## Running the Web App
As of now the app is only available when I run Flask on my personal machine. Trying to host on Azure once I add more features to come such as recaptcha and crypto.

Anyone can use the link to vist the web page as long as the server is running.
