In order to run the web application, do the following:

1. Access the code using the online CS50 IDE, ```https://ide.cs50.io/```, which has installed libraries for the application to work and a GUI for the SQL                  databases (You will need to login with Aarya's credentials to gain access to the code).
2. Within the terminal, enter the API key from IEX Cloud (Aarya has it)
3. Run the Flask server
4. Click the link that will take you to the web page

Anyone can use the link to vist the web page as long as the server is running.

*The server will close when the IDE is closed or you type Ctrl+C in the terminal*
